        <div class="entry-content">
          <h4><strong>About the Summit</strong></h4>
          <p><strong>“North East Development Summit” to be held on 21-22 November 2017 at Imphal, Manipur, is an effort to highlight and explore the potential of North East India in further establishing itself as a land hub of India’s Act East Policy. The Northeast is a natural partner in India’s ‘Act East Policy’, being our land bridge to Association for South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the Act East Policy is a means to strengthen the stability, economy and prospects of our North Eastern region. The Act East Policy can significantly factor in ending the geographical isolation of India’s North Eastern Region and transforming it into a bridgehead for India to the booming ASEAN markets and its extended neighbourhood. Given the economic potential as well as the geo-political importance of the region the North East Region lies at the core of India’s Act East Policy. The focus is now on economic development and addressing ‘trust deficit’. The opening up of the landlocked NER economically to ASEAN countries and extended neighbours is considered as a potent means of conflict transformation. The aspect of economic linkages should be explored and nurtured to further strengthen ties and contribute in the development of the North-East India.</strong></p>
          <h4><strong>Key Focus Areas:</strong></h4>
          <p><strong>Trade &amp; Investment</strong>:<br>
          India’s North East Region is at the forefront of becoming the growth engine of India’s economic development. North East Region is an important destination for trade and investment because of its export potential and this sub-regional market centre acts as a land-bridge connecting India to the South East Asian market.</p>
          <p><strong>Connectivity &amp; Infrastructure Development:<br>
          </strong>Connectivity is necessary to interlink growth centres, connect to border trade points, promote tourism and support social and security needs and realise the goals of peace and prosperity. Connectivity in all its dimensions – physical, institutional and people-to-people – continues to be a strategic priority for India in the North East Region.<strong><br>
          </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Tourism Development in the Region:</strong><br>
          The Northeast region that is rich in culture and the eco-system has a great potential for sustainable tourism ranging from leisure and adventure tourism to pilgrimage tourism and eco-tourism. Developing tourism connectivity with other parts of India is as important an element of strides in tourism as developing links with Southeast Asian countries.</p>
          <p><strong>Skill Development, Capacity Building &amp; Entrepreneurship:<br>
          </strong>The Youth is the vibrant force in North East India. And with the region which is fast evolving as a hub of new technology, innovation and emerging social &amp; business ventures, this provides unprecedented opportunity and scope for entrepreneurship and start-ups in North East.</p>
